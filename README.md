# Lenti Terminal

Lenti Terminal is a simple command-line interpreter written in Python and C (the c version is not that much funcationle). It allows users to enter commands and execute them in a terminal-like environment.

## Installation

To use Lenti Terminal, you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You also need to install the `colorama` library by running the following command:

```
pip install colorama
```

or

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use Lenti Terminal, simply run the `lenti_terminal.py` script. This will open a terminal-like environment where you can enter commands.

Lenti Terminal supports the following commands:

- `print`: Prints one or two words.

- `help`: Displays a list of available commands.

- `add`: Adds two numbers and prints the result.

- `read`: Reads the content of a file and prints it.

- `write`: Writes content to a file.

- `append`: Appends content to a file.

- `copy`: Copies a file.

- `rename`: Renames a file.

- `delete`: Deletes a file.

To use a command, simply enter it in the terminal followed by the appropriate arguments. For example, to add two numbers, you can enter the following command:

```
add 3 4
```

This will add the numbers 3 and 4 and print the result.
